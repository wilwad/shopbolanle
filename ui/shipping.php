  <h3>Payment & Shipping terms</h3>
      <p>As each piece is customised and designed to the client’s specific requirements, clients need to request for a quote and include all specifications.</p>
      <p>A quote will be sent to the client’s preferred email address within 48 hours.</p> 
      <p><i>Note: Please also check your SPAM as emails may incorrectly be sent there. </i></p>
      <!--<p>On acceptance of the quote, 50% of the price will need to be paid, and the remainder on shipping.</p> -->
      <p>After acceptance and full payment of the quote, pieces will be shipped and delivered to the client’s preferred location. Times of delivery will be communicated within the quote due to the variations in production times.</p>
